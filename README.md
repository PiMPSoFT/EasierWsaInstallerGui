# What is wsa gui?
wsa-gui is a project that has been converted to a wsa-script graphical interface and is intended for you to write less command lines.

# Are you looking for my command line instead of the graphical interface?

Try our [wsa-script](https://github.com/herrwinfried/wsa-script) project
