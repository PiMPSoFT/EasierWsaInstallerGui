# The under construction

I would like to give the opportunity to try new OSS projects in the Developing World. One of the reasons for this is that I cannot produce a Form on Linux with WinForm. Most of My Day was spent this year with linux. That's why it's always better for me to have most of them Cross-Platform, including the projects I develop on Windows.

# When it will be ready?

When it's ready. I can't specify a time because I have to write the codes from scratch.

# Will this be different from previous winform features?

Probably No.

## So what is the Framework you will be using? 

Frankly, I didn't want to change the programming language. So I'm going to use **[AvaloniUI](https://avaloniaui.net)**.
